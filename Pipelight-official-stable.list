# We have prepared a PPA archive for Ubuntu which provides you with prebuilt binarys and automatic updates. It contains Pipelight and our patched wine version, which is installed to a separate location and won't conflict with your regular wine installation. Simply use apt-get to install Pipelight and the package system will take of all required dependencies.
# Just type the following commands in your terminal to add the repository and to install pipelight-multi package:
# 
# 1. sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pipelight/stable
# 2. sudo apt-get update
# 3. sudo apt-get install --install-recommends pipelight-multi
# 4. sudo pipelight-plugin --update
